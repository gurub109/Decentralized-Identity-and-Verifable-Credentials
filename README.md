# Decentralized Identity
Decentralized Identity (DID), also know as "self-sovereign identity" (or SSI) is driven by open web standards at organizations such as W3C, Decentralized Identity Foundation and the Hyperledger Project at Linux Foundation.

DIDs are cryptographically secure identifiers that are owned and controlled by a user without a third party Identity Providers (IdPs). It enables the user to prove the ownership of the identity using thier wallet (eg. a mobile device). Using the DID, the user can obtain Verifiable Credentials (VCs) from trusted organizations and, subsequently, present elements of these credentials as proof of claims without the need to authenticate with service providers using usernames and passwords.

# Verifiable Credentials
Identity records are used in everyones daily lives. Driver license is used as evidence to operate a vehicle, education institutions issue diplomas that prove the education qualifications, passports are used to prove the nationality, etc. Verifable Credential (VC) specification defines a model how we could issue, store and verify the data over the internat but in a secure manner that respects user's privacy.  

## Standards

* [The Verifable Credential Data Model 1.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/)



## Model
DIDs and VCs typically involves three
